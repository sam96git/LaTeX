		\centerline{\textbf{Probability}}

	\item A speaks truth in 60\% of the cases, while B in 90\% of the cases. In what percent of cases are they likely to contradict each other in stating the same fact? In the cases of contradiction do you think, the statement of B will carry more weight as he speaks truth in more number of cases than A?

	\item Assume that the chances of a patient having a heart attack is 40$\%$. Assuming that a meditation and yoga course reduces the risk of heart attack by 30$\%$ and prescription of certain drug reduces its chance by 25$\%$. At a time a patient can choose any one of the two options with equal probabilities. It is given that after going through one of the two options, the patient selected at random suffers a heart attack. Find the probability that the patient followed a course of meditation and yoga. Interpret the result and state which of the above stated methods is more beneficial for the patient.\\

		\centerline{\textbf{Linear programming}}

	\item A cooperative society of farmers has $50$ hectares of land to grow two crops A and B. The profits from crops A and B per hectare are estimated as $10,500$ and $9,000$ respectively. To control weeds, a liquid herbicide has to be used for crops A and B at the rate of $20$ litres and $10$ litres per hectare, respectively. Further not more than $800$ litres of herbicide should be used in order to protect fish and wildlife using a pond which collects drainage from this land. Keeping in mind that the protection of fish and other wildlife is more important than earning profit, how much land should be allocated to each crop so as to maximize the total profit$?$ Form an LPP from the above and solve it graphically. Do you agree with the message that the protection of wildlife is utmost necessary to preserve the balance in environment $?$
